## How h10_viewer.py Works

The heart of the polarecgvis project is `h10_viewer.py`, which performs several key functions:

### 1. Data Loading and Processing

- **CSV Parsing**: Reads ECG data from CSV files with 2-4 columns (timestamps, ECG values, HR, RR)
- **Sample Rate Detection**: Uses mode of time differences to robustly estimate sampling frequency
- **Signal Filtering**: Applies bandpass filtering (5-20 Hz) to isolate QRS complexes
- **Peak Detection**: Identifies R-peaks using adaptive thresholding and minimum distance constraints

### 2. Heart Rate and RR Interval Analysis

- **RR Interval Calculation**: Measures time between consecutive R-peaks
- **Instantaneous Heart Rate**: Calculates beat-to-beat heart rate (60/RR)
- **Smoothing**: Applies rolling median filters to reduce noise
- **HR Dip Detection**: Identifies significant drops in heart rate compared to baseline

### 3. Breathing Rate Estimation

The breathing rate estimation leverages a phenomenon called respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), where heart rate naturally varies with the respiratory cycle. This technique extracts breathing rate without direct respiratory measurements:

1. **Physiological Basis**:
   - During inhalation, heart rate slightly increases
   - During exhalation, heart rate slightly decreases
   - These cyclical variations in heart rate (RR intervals) contain information about breathing frequency

2. **RR Interval Preprocessing**:
   - Filters out invalid/missing values from RR interval series
   - Creates unique time points to handle duplicate timestamps
   - Resamples RR intervals to a uniform 4 Hz time series using linear interpolation
   
3. **Respiratory Band Isolation**:
   - Applies detrending to remove slow drift in RR intervals
   - Uses a bandpass filter (0.15-0.40 Hz) to isolate frequencies corresponding to normal breathing range (9-24 breaths/minute)
   - Implements a sliding window approach (10-second windows with 80% overlap) to assess signal quality
   - Masks low-quality segments where respiratory sinus arrhythmia power is too low relative to total RR variability
   
4. **Hilbert Transform Analysis**:
   - Applies Hilbert transform to convert the filtered RR signal into an analytic signal
   - Extracts the instantaneous phase of this analytic signal using the `np.angle()` function
   - Unwraps the phase to prevent discontinuities
   - Smooths the unwrapped phase using a Savitzky-Golay filter (adaptive polynomial fitting)
   
5. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - Calculates instantaneous frequency by taking the derivative of the smoothed phase
   - Converts from radians/sample to Hz by dividing by 2Ï€ and multiplying by sampling rate
   - Clips values to physiologically plausible breathing frequencies (0-0.7 Hz)
   - Converts to breaths per minute (multiplying by 60)
   
6. **Post-processing**:
   - Applies rolling median filter to smooth the breathing rate estimate
   - Marks low-quality segments as NaN
   - Forward-fills short gaps to produce a continuous breathing rate signal

This algorithm represents a sophisticated application of signal processing to derive respiratory information from cardiac data, without requiring additional sensors.

### 4. Understanding Cardiac Terms and Detection Methods

#### What are these cardiac events?

1. **QRS Complex**:
   - The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarization in an ECG
   - Normal QRS duration is typically 80-120 ms
   - QRS width is measured from the beginning of the Q wave to the end of the S wave

2. **Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC)**:
   - Early heartbeat originating from the ventricles (not the normal pacemaker)
   - Characteristic features:
     - Premature (occurs earlier than expected)
     - Wide QRS complex (>120 ms) due to abnormal conduction
     - Different morphology (shape) compared to normal beats
     - Often followed by a compensatory pause
     - Usually lacks a preceding P-wave

3. **Premature Atrial Contraction (PAC)**:
   - Early heartbeat originating from the atria outside the normal pacemaker
   - Characteristic features:
     - Premature (occurs earlier than expected)
     - Normal QRS width and morphology
     - Often has a visible but abnormal P-wave
     - Usually no compensatory pause
   
4. **Wide QRS Complex**:
   - Any beat with prolonged ventricular depolarization
   - Could be due to bundle branch block, ventricular origin, or aberrant conduction
   - Defined as QRS duration >120-130 ms

#### How the algorithm detects these events

1. **QRS Width Measurement**:
   ```python
   def qrs_width(ecg_f, r_idx, fs, frac=0.5, max_ms=200):
       # Calculate threshold as fraction of peak amplitude
       pk_amp = abs(ecg_f[r_idx])
       thr = frac * pk_amp
       
       # Walk left from peak until signal falls below threshold
       l = r_idx
       while l > 0 and abs(ecg_f[l]) > thr and r_idx - l < win:
           l -= 1
           
       # Walk right from peak until signal falls below threshold
       r = r_idx
       while r < len(ecg_f) - 1 and abs(ecg_f[r]) > thr and r - r_idx < win:
           r += 1
       
       # Calculate width in milliseconds
       return (r - l) / fs * 1000.0
   ```
   - The algorithm walks left and right from the R-peak until the signal falls below a specified threshold
   - The time between these points is calculated as the QRS width in milliseconds

2. **PVC Detection**:
   The algorithm uses a multi-factor scoring system to identify PVCs:
   - **Prematurity**: Checks if the RR interval before the beat is significantly shorter than the median (>20% early)
   - **QRS Width**: Measures if width exceeds threshold (130 ms)
   - **Morphology Analysis**: Compares beat shape to normal template beats using correlation
   - **Compensatory Pause**: Checks if the RR interval after the beat is longer than normal
   - **P-Wave Absence**: Looks for missing P-wave before the QRS complex
   
   PVC confidence score formula:
   ```
   pvc_score = 0
   if is_premature: pvc_score += 0.3
   if is_wide_qrs: pvc_score += 0.3
   if different_morphology: pvc_score += 0.2
   if has_compensatory_pause: pvc_score += 0.1
   if not has_p_wave: pvc_score += 0.1
   ```
   
   A score above 0.7-0.8 is classified as a PVC.

3. **PAC Detection**:
   Similar scoring system used:
   - **Prematurity**: Checks if the beat is early
   - **Normal QRS Width**: Ensures QRS width is not increased
   - **P-Wave Presence**: Detects if abnormal P-wave is present
   - **Normal Morphology**: Confirms QRS shape is similar to normal beats
   - **No Compensatory Pause**: Verifies lack of long pause after the beat
   
   PAC confidence score formula:
   ```
   pac_score = 0
   if is_premature: pac_score += 0.3
   if not is_wide_qrs: pac_score += 0.3
   if has_p_wave: pac_score += 0.3
   if similar_morphology: pac_score += 0.1
   if not has_compensatory_pause: pac_score += 0.2
   ```
   
   A score above 0.7-0.8 is classified as a PAC.

4. **HR Dip Detection**:
   - Calculates instantaneous HR from RR intervals
   - Applies rolling median filter to smooth HR
   - Computes baseline HR using a wider window (20-beat rolling median)
   - Detects edges where HR drops more than 30-35 BPM below baseline
   - Marks these locations as significant HR dips

This approach combines traditional ECG analysis techniques with modern signal processing and statistical methods to provide more reliable detection of potential arrhythmias.
